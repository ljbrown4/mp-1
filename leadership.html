                <h3> <em><u>Resident Assistant: Boston University </u></em> --- August 2024 - Present</h3>
                <p> As an RA, I interact with the residents regularly, fostering a supportive and
                    engaging environment. I hold community meetings at least once a month to review
                    policies and procedures, while also focusing on community building and addressing
                    any community issues. I assist in facilitating hall openings and closings throughout the year,
                    ensuring a smooth transition for residents. I handle both routine and emergency maintenance
                    requests, as well as other resident concerns that may arise. Additionally, I anticipate
                    residents' needs, identify potential problems, and make appropriate referrals to help them
                    overcome obstacles such as personal fears, uncertainties, and conflicts.
