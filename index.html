                <p>
                  Hello! I’m <strong><em>Leigh Brown</em></strong>, a sophomore at Boston University pursuing a Bachelor’s in <strong><em>Computer Science</em></strong>
                  with a minor in <strong><em>Advertising</em></strong> .
                  My passion for technology began in high school, where I discovered the thrill of solving problems and building creative solutions
                  through code. Currently, I’m exploring web app development while honing my skills in <strong>Python, Java, and C.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond programming, I bring leadership and technical expertise from my roles as a Senior Tech Support member in high school and a
                  Resident Assistant at BU. Additionally, my experience as a Store Associate at Michaels has strengthened my customer service, organizational,
                  and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to thrive in fast-paced environments. With 14 years of dance experience, I’ve cultivated
                  creativity, discipline, and adaptability—qualities that shape my approach to challenges.
                </p>
