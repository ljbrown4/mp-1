                  Hello, my name is Leigh Brown, and I’m a sophomore at Boston University,
                  where I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Advertising.
                  I discovered my passion for computer science during my junior year of high school, and
                  since then, I’ve been deeply engaged in learning how to solve problems and build creative
                  solutions through technology. At university, I am exploring web app development while strengthening my skills in Python, Java, and C.
                  Beyond coding, I have experience in tech support and leadership as a former Senior Tech
                  Support member in high school and now as a Resident Assistant. With 14 years of dance experience,
                  I have developed creativity, discipline, and adaptability, which shape the way I approach problem-solving.
                  I am always learning, experimenting, and looking for new opportunities to grow.
